# Lazy LaTeX

Writing a LaTeX document can be time-consuming and tiring without shortcuts. This repository collects various shortcuts for arrows, (mathematical) environments, operators, symbols and text remplacement. The aim of this project is to extend [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) by James Yu.

## Manual installation

LaTeX snippets are accessible from `Visual Studio Code > Preferences > User snippets > latex.json`. All you have to do is to paste the pieces of code you want on the `Visual Studio Code > Preferences > User snippets > latex.json` file.

## Notes

The packages for the Xmath and Xwriter collections are currently unavailable for download. If you have any suggestions, please send a pull request.
